						<h3>Is this an official Progress<sup>&reg;</sup> Sitefinity<sup>&#8482;</sup> project or a pet project?</h3>
						<p>
							Project Feather is an official Progress<sup>&reg;</sup> Sitefinity<sup>&#8482;</sup> project. Everything that is done gets shipped with Sitefinity CMS and is supported through the regular support channels. 
						</p>
					</li>

						<h3>Why open source?</h3>
						<p>
							There are several reasons for this. As front-end work is so heavily customized, we want you to be able to fork Project Feather and make it what you need it to be. We also want you to see how we approach front-end development and expose what we think are best practices. Finally, while we do not expect or rely on you to contribute, we will be more than happy to review and accept pull requests.
						</p>

						<h3>How will you support Project Feather?</h3>
						<p>To benefit from the <b>guaranteed response time</b> according to your Support Plan included in your license, please submit a support ticket. Any bugs or feature requests, submitted as support tickets will be logged by our support team members.</p>
						<p>To <b>share the issue with the community</b>, get help from other users and have your issue reviewed by development team members directly, please open a github issue. </p>
						<p>Although we make the best effort to respond timely and efficiently, please consider that development team responses to github issues are not time-bound and may vary widely according to issue complexity and team availability.</p>

						<h3>Why is this a separate project and not just released as part of Sitefinity CMS?</h3>
						<p>
							We want to have an independent release cycle which allows you to see what we are doing and have a say in the direction we take. 
						</p>
					</li>	
					<li>
						<i class="fa fa-question feather-icon"></i>
						<h3>How do you ship?</h3>
						<p>
							First and foremost, as a module in the latest official Sitefinity CMS release. In addition, we periodically ship new releases as NuGet packages.
